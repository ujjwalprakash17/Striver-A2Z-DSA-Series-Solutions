1. When the problem is based on intervals, where we need to find intervals
   type 1: minimum no of groups required to form non overlapping intervals.  
    maximum number of overlapping intervals at any time = minimum number of groups required, such that
   no two intervals should be overlapping.

2. Read about the concept of problem : Zero Array Transformation I
   Approach : Based on the inteval Value we need to find the number of occurance of elements in that interval for
   Ex : [[0, 2] , [1,4], [0, 5], [3, 5]] is poore interval me 1 kitni baar hai 0, kitni baar
   also both inclusive
   Solution : har interval ke starting index ko +1 kro aur (ending element + 1) ko -1 kro
   for example
   index -> [0] => val = 1;
   index -> [3] => val = -1;
   aur aisa krte krte phir har ek element ko array ke each element ke prefixSum ke value se replace krte chalo

3. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right:
   Problem : Read the problem and then you will know that we need to count the value from both sides and which side
   to choose first is very tough to find out.
   we can't even apply dp.
   In this case we need to use sliding window, but
   -> Very Important : to apply sliding window on two ends of the array,
   we can also use Reverse engineering and will try to find out the middle window where out of the windows elements
   occurances are greater than >= k.
   we need to maximize the size of windows so that we can extend the window, and
   this is what our approach will be.

4. finding the pivot element in binarySearch 
   finding the smallest element in sorted and rotated array
   Approach : 
   1. Tip : Whenever we need not to check last element, we can keep e = mid, and 
   if we need to check startInd then we can keep it as s = mid + 1;
   Now whenever the value of mid is smaller than the value of end 
   then e = mid; 
   else s = mid + 1;
   return the start Index
